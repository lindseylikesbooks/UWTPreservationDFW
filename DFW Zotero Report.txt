          Notes:

      o
          + Thoroughly discusses what exactly climate change does to
            cultural heritage (namely, all objects undergo cycles of
            environmental change, but climate change alters the
            frequency and intensity of these changes)
          + Identifies factors involved in evaluating the threats caused
            by climate change, as well as a strong framework for
            assessing these risks in an institution’s collection.
          + Identifies types of environmental change and literature
            discussing where these changes have been noted.
          + Overall, an extremely rich, thorough survey of current
            literature at the intersection of climate change research
            and collection care.

          Notes:

      o
          + The current disaster response plan for all libraries in the
            UW system.
          + Provides good guidance for dealing with various threats to
            collections, including contact information for emergency
            services and other help.
          + Lays out specific University policies for how to handle
            various situations.
          + Lacks specialized advice for the different campuses -- the
            document is very generalized beyond the inclusion of
            University resources and policies.

          + A scientific article meant to address biological, chemical
            and mechanical decay as caused by indoor air conditions.
          + Addresses the dilemma posed by HVAC: it both consumes a
            great deal of energy while being essential for keeping
            materials safe from air pollutants, humidity, and high
            temperatures.
