## Preservation and Emergency Preparedness at UW Tacoma

During spring quarter 2022, I will be working with UW Tacoma Libraries to reevaluate the institution's preservation and emergency preparedness plans with a focus on how climate change may impact collection safety. This site acts as a repository of work and reflections from this project.

### Week 1 Reflections

To begin this project, I reached out to staff members from both Access Services and Collections to determine the needs of the library. I discovered that this project was much needed as the library's spaces have recently changed and found that most collections materials are located in just one of the library's two buildings, which adds some more interesting things to consider as I embark on this project. My plan at the moment is to determine where to begin my research upon meeting with staff members at the beginning of this coming week, read and annotate at least a couple articles, and report back. There should be quite a bit to discuss in my next reflection!

### Week 2 Reflections

This week I met with Megan Watson, who is a part of Collections at UW Tacoma Library. This was an extremely useful meeting, and afterwards Megan was kind enough to send photos of some of the areas of concern in the building. 

Since I've never been to the Pacific Northwest, where the library is located, discussing the climate and weather patterns of the area was a large part of the conversation: I learned that the period from October to April is very wet and snow can occur as late as April, and that the area is quite humid. As climate change progresses, the increasing heat of summers is a big concern, especially because the power in the library has been known to go out. 

We also discussed some concerns about layout in the library, and touched a bit on system policies relating to how conservation needs are addressed at various campuses. This has given me a lot of help in determining next steps, and gives me some good questions to ask as I move into my next meetings with staff.

### Week 3 Reflections

This week was mainly spent gathering articles in the wake of what I learned in my meeting with Megan, but I've hit quite a bit of a roadblock in that the sources I'm finding are not at all what I expected. I had worked on an emergency preparadness plan at an internship years ago, but there was no focus on climate change, and sources on climate change are where I'm having difficulty. Not only are many of these written at a level intended for other climate scientists -- which I am not -- but also they tend to be hyperspecific to the point that their findings are difficult to apply. I forgot to consider how often publications are written for colleagues and not outside audiences, and I'm currently unsure of how to continue. I have found some excellent toolkits intended for libraries, though, but these do little to lend themselves towards my original plan of writing a literature guide. It seems as though I need to put my humanities brain to the side and approach this with a new perspective. I have a meeting with my supervisors planned so I'll discuss what I should do with them. 

### Week 4 Reflections

After talking with my supervisors, we've decided to shift from a literature review to a sort of informal annotated bibliography. Since this is a resource primarily intended for internal use, the focus will be to make the resources I've found findable and to highlight the pieces in each resource that is most useful and relevant for our institution. 

I also scheduled a meeting with someone in access services for next week as recommended by both Megan and my supervisors. As someone who has worked in access services before myself, I know firsthand how they're truly the ones who best understand the current state of collections care and emergency preparedness, so I'm very excited to hear their perspective.
