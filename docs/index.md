## Preservation and Emergency Preparedness at UW Tacoma

During spring quarter 2022, I will be working with UW Tacoma Libraries to reevaluate the institution's preservation and emergency preparedness plans with a focus on how climate change may impact collection safety. This site acts as a repository of work and reflections from this project.

### Week 1 Reflections

To begin this project, I reached out to staff members from both Access Services and Collections to determine the needs of the library. I discovered that this project was much needed as the library's spaces have recently changed and found that most collections materials are located in just one of the library's two buildings, which adds some more interesting things to consider as I embark on this project. My plan at the moment is to determine where to begin my research upon meeting with staff members at the beginning of this coming week, read and annotate at least a couple articles, and report back. There should be quite a bit to discuss in my next reflection!

### Week 2 Reflections

This week I met with Megan Watson, who is a part of Collections at UW Tacoma Library. This was an extremely useful meeting, and afterwards Megan was kind enough to send photos of some of the areas of concern in the building. 

Since I've never been to the Pacific Northwest, where the library is located, discussing the climate and weather patterns of the area was a large part of the conversation: I learned that the period from October to April is very wet and snow can occur as late as April, and that the area is quite humid. As climate change progresses, the increasing heat of summers is a big concern, especially because the power in the library has been known to go out. 

We also discussed some concerns about layout in the library, and touched a bit on system policies relating to how conservation needs are addressed at various campuses. This has given me a lot of help in determining next steps, and gives me some good questions to ask as I move into my next meetings with staff.

### Week 3 Reflections

This week was mainly spent gathering articles in the wake of what I learned in my meeting with Megan, but I've hit quite a bit of a roadblock in that the sources I'm finding are not at all what I expected. I had worked on an emergency preparadness plan at an internship years ago, but there was no focus on climate change, and sources on climate change are where I'm having difficulty. Not only are many of these written at a level intended for other climate scientists -- which I am not -- but also they tend to be hyperspecific to the point that their findings are difficult to apply. I forgot to consider how often publications are written for colleagues and not outside audiences, and I'm currently unsure of how to continue. I have found some excellent toolkits intended for libraries, though, but these do little to lend themselves towards my original plan of writing a literature guide. It seems as though I need to put my humanities brain to the side and approach this with a new perspective. I have a meeting with my supervisors planned so I'll discuss what I should do with them. 

### Week 4 Reflections

After talking with my supervisors, we've decided to shift from a literature review to a sort of informal annotated bibliography. Since this is a resource primarily intended for internal use, the focus will be to make the resources I've found findable and to highlight the pieces in each resource that is most useful and relevant for our institution. 

I also scheduled a meeting with someone in access services for next week as recommended by both Megan and my supervisors. As someone who has worked in access services before myself, I know firsthand how they're truly the ones who best understand the current state of collections care and emergency preparedness, so I'm very excited to hear their perspective. 

### Week 5 Reflections

I had a meeting with Hannah from Access Services this week, and as expected the meeting was extremely helpful. My main takeaways are that while UW has emergency preparedness policies as a system, there is nothing localized to Tacoma and there is currently no physical plan. She said that the new spaces aren't too concerning since they were all designed for library use, but that the 4th floor is a bit flimsy and earthquake preparedness generally is very much needed. She recommended that I also talk to Stanley in facilities as he is very much interested in how climate change will effect facility maintenance, and I set up a meeting to do so next week.

### Week 6 Reflections

My talk with Stanley was rather short, but turned out to be one of the most informative things I've done all quarter. From him I learned that our HVAC system currently is designed to deal with a maximum temperature of around 85-95 degrees, and if temperatures go above that we need to dial back and allow the room temperature to go up to around 75 degrees. Fires and a lack of fresh water are a big concern climate-wise, and fires are especially worrying given the fact that poor air quality forces closing off outside air, increasing the risk of COVID for those inside the building. I really appreciated him tying in how COVID relates to all of this, as I feel it's often left out of the conversation despite it still being a real, major issue. 

On the bright side, floors and spaes can be isolated by the VRF system, and the library as a whole is considered a critical location with an isolated system on campus. This information gives me the last pieces of information I really needed to understand how to approach Tacoma's specific needs.

### Week 7 Reflections

This turned out to be an incredibly difficult week for me, so I mostly took time for myself and seeking out support. I hope to get back to readings next week.

### Week 8 Reflections

Things really don't stop happening. I'm working through readings as much as I can, but struggling to process or retain information. I spoke to my supervisors and they agreed that I need to rest more and go easier on myself, but I tend to struggle with this. I think they're right though -- I don't have to stop working on this once my DFW is over, so why rush it when I so clearly need rest? To get really corny, I've realized that I know how to write plans and policies for objects, but caring for my own needs and longevity in this field is so much harder. So I'm trying to take the advice I've gotten with the hope as always that next week will be better.

### Week 9 Reflections

I finally got a bit of work done on my annotated bibliography. It's just bullet points right now, but it's something and it's useable. I can't say I'm proud of the work itself as it stands right now, but I'm proud that I communicated my struggles and got support, I took the rest I needed to avoid getting too burnt out to even get this far, and I met at least a small milestone. I plan to clean it up still, but at least the content is now there.

### Week 10 Reflections

This quarter turned out to be one of the most difficult periods of my entire education due to personal matters, but I'm proud I could still do a little bit to help an institution I care about. I wasn't able to meet my original (admittedly lofty) goals entirely, but I plan to continue work on this project throughout the summer so that I can hopefully still meet them at a pace that makes more sense for my mental and emotional state right now. It's good to remember that the tight deadlines required by university programs don't always exist in the workplace, and I'm greatful to my supervisors for being so flexible and understanding. This is it for my reflections this quarter, but my work continues.
