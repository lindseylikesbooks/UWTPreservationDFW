## Preservation and Emergency Preparedness at UW Tacoma

During spring quarter 2022, I will be working with UW Tacoma Libraries to reevaluate the institution's preservation and emergency preparedness plans with a focus on how climate change may impact collection safety. This site acts as a repository of work and reflections from this project.

### Week 1 Reflections

To begin this project, I reached out to staff members from both Access Services and Collections to determine the needs of the library. I discovered that this project was much needed as the library's spaces have recently changed and found that most collections materials are located in just one of the library's two buildings, which adds some more interesting things to consider as I embark on this project. My plan at the moment is to determine where to begin my research upon meeting with staff members at the beginning of this coming week, read and annotate at least a couple articles, and report back. There should be quite a bit to discuss in my next reflection!
